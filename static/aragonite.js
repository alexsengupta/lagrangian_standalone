// aragonite.js - legacy UI removed
// Replaced with a no-op placeholder as part of the "hard cleanup" requested.
// This file previously contained legacy UI code for the aragonite globe/map.
// Keeping a placeholder (instead of deleting) so deploys referencing this file won't fail.
//
// If you need to restore the legacy implementation later, replace this file with
// the original contents from version control or backup.
